# Introduction

The **SWiMS 2024 Survey** explores the mental health and well-being of mid-level academic staff (e.g., doctoral researchers, scientific associates, postdocs, and other scientific staff) in Switzerland. The goal is to identify problems and areas for improvement in working conditions and research environments. This report focuses on the national level description of the data.

# Sample Description

The analyzed sample consist of `r nrow(dat)`. For details on data cleaning, see section XX.

Section XX
Only institutions with more than 10 responses were considered in this report. 43 participants of 16 institution with a mean of 2.7 (SD = 1.81) participants were removed from the dataset. We also exculded participants that took shorter than 4 minutes to respond (n = 4). 
62 additional responses were removed because institution "Other" (n = 44), "Prefer not to say" (n = 15), or were missing (n = 3) were indicated. In total, `r nrow(dat)` responses were part of this report.


## Parttaking institutions and response

```{r, echo = F}

# Calculate the number of participants for each institution
institution_counts <- dat %>%
  group_by(inst) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  filter(count > 10)

# Filter the data to include only institutions with more than 20 participants
filtered_dat <- dat %>%
  filter(inst %in% institution_counts$inst)

# Get the maximum count to set y-axis limit
max_count <- max(institution_counts$count)
sum_count <- sum(institution_counts$count)

# Create the plot
ggplot(filtered_dat, aes(x = reorder(factor(inst), table(inst)[factor(inst)]), y = ..count..)) +  
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5, face = "italic")
  ) +
  labs(
   # title = "Number of Responses by Institution",
    x = "Institution Name",
    y = "Number of Responses",
    caption = paste("Total count: ",sum_count ,"\n",
                    "Only institutions with more than 10 participants are displayed.")
  ) +
  geom_text(stat = 'count', aes(label = ..count..), hjust = -0.1, size = 3.5) +
  ylim(c(0, max_count + 30)) +
  coord_flip()

#ggsave(paste0("../plots/SWiMS_responses_",date ,".pdf"), height = 7, width = 8)
```

The average duration of responding to the survey was `r round(mean(dat[dat$duration < 2*3600,"duration"]/60, na.rm =T),2)` minutes (SD = `r round(sd(dat[dat$duration < 2*3600,"duration"]/60, na.rm =T),2)`).

### Response Rate

TODO: do we want to do this? it will just look bad!
