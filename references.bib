	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the reliability and validity of a single-item overall job satisfaction measure.
METHODS: Public agency employees (n = 745) were surveyed regarding job satisfaction, work, personality, and health variables. The single-item measure underwent the following analyses: correction for attenuation formula to estimate minimum reliability; correlations with multiple-item job satisfaction, work, personality, and health measures to determine concurrent validity, construct validity, and specific relevance to health promotion; and logistic regression to determine the predictability of turnover intention.
RESULTS: For the single-item measure the minimum reliability estimate was high, all correlational tests for validity were significant, logistic regression indicated substantial predictability of turnover intention, and correlations with the health measures were significant.
DISCUSSION: These results are consistent with other studies and support the psychometric properties of this single-item overall job satisfaction measure. Limitations of the study and its implications for worksite health promotion are discussed.},

	abstract = {The short German-language version of the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scales (DASS) is used in pain research and treatment and was developed to assess core psychological aspects of depression, anxiety, and stress. It includes three scales with seven items each. The assessment of psychological distress is of central importance in pain research and treatment. For depression as a comorbidity in pain, there are particular methodological and conceptual difficulties. Reliability: Cronbach's alpha was alpha = .91 (depression), alpha = .78-.82 (anxiety) and alpha = .81-.89 (stress). Validity: Construct validity of the DASS were compared with HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and ADS (General Depression Scale). Specificity and sensitivity for depression were determined using a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SKID) and also compared with ADS and HADS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burnout has negative effects on work performance and patient care. The current standard for burnout assessment is the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), a well-validated instrument consisting of 22 items answered on a 7-point Likert scale. However, the length of the MBI can limit its utility in physician surveys.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of two questions relative to the full MBI for measuring burnout.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional data from 2,248 medical students, 333 internal medicine residents, 465 internal medicine faculty, and 7,905 practicing surgeons.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The single questions with the highest factor loading on the emotional exhaustion (EE) ("I feel burned out from my work") and depersonalization (DP) ("I have become more callous toward people since I took this job") domains of burnout were evaluated in four large samples of medical students, internal medicine residents, internal medicine faculty, and practicing surgeons. Spearman correlations between the single EE question and the full EE domain score minus that question ranged from 0.76-0.83. Spearman correlations between the single DP question and the full DP domain score minus that question ranged from 0.61-0.72. Responses to the single item measures of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization stratified risk of high burnout in the relevant domain on the full MBI, with consistent patterns across the four sampled groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Single item measures of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization provide meaningful information on burnout in medical professionals.},
